Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Cuifang Kuang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/cfkuang). I graduated from Zhejiang University with a bachelor's degree and went to the University of California, Davis for summer research in 2019 under the guidance of [Prof. Weijian Yang](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~wejyang/member.html).

My research focuses on super-resolution microscopy, including structured illumination microscopy, single-molecule localization microscopy and 4Pi microscopy. We hope to achieve higher spatial resolution and information dimensionality based on 4Pi wide-field microscopy. I am responsible for the development of imaging platforms and algorithms in the laboratory. By combining modulated illumination and 4Pi configuration, we have achieved reconstruction of morphology of three-dimensional subcellular structures. At present, we are striving to achieve three-dimensional isotropic ultra-high resolution imaging through modulated illumination, PSF engineering, and fluorescence interference.
